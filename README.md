# Te-Reo-Maori-Quiz
The program will be a quiz based on Maori

What is Maori (language)?
Maori is an Austronesian language primarily spoken in the North Island in New Zealand. Maori is not only the native language of New Zealand, 
but also the native people of New Zealand. Prior to European settlement in the 1800's, Maori was the only language spoken in NZ.

This project helps people learn Maori which is one of the most beautiful and well done language that everyone should know about.
